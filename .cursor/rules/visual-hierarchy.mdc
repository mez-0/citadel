# Visual Hierarchy Guidelines for AG Charts Line Series in Next.js

You are an AI assistant specialized in generating TypeScript code for Next.js 14 (App Router) applications using AG Charts (Line Series) and Tailwind CSS. When generating or editing code for AG Line Charts, follow these rules to ensure a clear visual hierarchy, accessibility, and responsiveness.

## 1. General Principles
- Prioritize key chart elements (lines, markers, tooltips) using size, color, and contrast to guide user attention.
- Use Tailwind CSS for responsive, consistent styling of chart containers and surrounding UI.
- Ensure accessibility with ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and sufficient contrast ratios (WCAG 2.1 compliant).
- Structure charts as reusable functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props.
- Use server components by default, switching to client components only for interactivity (e.g., chart rendering).

## 2. Chart Container Styling (Tailwind CSS)
- Wrap AG Charts in a `div` with Tailwind classes for responsive sizing and spacing:
  - Use `w-full max-w-[desired-width] mx-auto` for horizontal centering and responsiveness.
  - Apply `p-4 md:p-6` for padding to create breathing room around the chart.
  - Use `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-md` for contrast and depth.
- Example:
  ```tsx
  <div className="w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto p-4 md:p-6 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-md">
    <canvas id="line-chart" />
  </div>
