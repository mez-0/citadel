# Citadel üõ°Ô∏è

Citadel is a payload analysis framework that I built to enable me to review payloads prior to using them on engagements. The inner PE parsing logic will also be used for future projects and will act as a core component to my research projects.

## üéØ Overview

Figuring out why an implant is being detected (statically) is a frustrating game. Tools such as ThreatCheck and GoCheck exist to tackle this problem, and do a decent job. However, an issue I had with these is that when I want to execute it, I need to copy a file onto a Virtual Machine. But, at this point, Defender would eat it before I even got to test it. That's where projects like avred come in, this introduces a HTTP API to allow a more remote implementation.
